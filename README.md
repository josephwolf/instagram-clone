instagram-clone
===============

This is an exercise set by Makers Academy on the 27th of May 2014.
The objective was to create a website with similar functionality to Instagram.com, using the ruby-on-rails framework and the twitter bootstrap bundle.

At this stage in development, user functionality has been implimented using the devise framework and online database storage and refrencing using PSQL and Amazon's S3 storage service.

To be implimented:
	Post tagging
	Post comments
	User interactions (follows, likes)
	Front page scrolling galleries using javascript
	JSON slick-ness

Known issues:
	A lot of visual formatting and alignment
	Code could use some drying out
